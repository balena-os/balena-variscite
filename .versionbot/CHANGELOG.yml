                Fix the ordering of the conditional check when starting the
                supervisor container;

                only check that the values being passed into the environment

                in the config IF the container already exists.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz
                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this
                file in

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                From u-boot docs:

                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

              hash: c935fcfd72dfefa5188d90edc48cd1b01dbadec2
              body: >
                Currently, because we bind mount apps.json unconditionally, when
                this

                file doesn't exist, balena engine will create a directory on the
                data

                filesystem. This breaks when we add an apps.json file after the

                supervisor container was already created.


                Fixes #1325

                Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager
                through its

                configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was

                enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which

                connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on
                the host,

                the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to
                loosen

                up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device -
                `resin-tun`

                - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing
                other tun

                devices.

                bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make
                sure that

                if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise
                the

                error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {

                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service

                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

        Updated resin-image to allow installing necessary bluetooth

        update upstream layers' machine.conf to use the
        MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS variable, as by default it
        was not working.

        Removed patch provided by u-boot-variscite upstream
        that was designed for newer versions of the imx7 SOC,
        starting from revision D. That patch increased the SPL
        text section base and garbage was being executed instead
        of the right start ruoutine. That patch isn't suitable
        for the current SOC revisions supported by balena, as it
        breaks booting.

        In the past we removed FORTIFY_SOURCE compiler flag because
        this flag in combination with the old gcc broke ssh connections.
        Now we are using newer gcc and we don't need to override this
        flag anymore.

                Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working

              hash: ef3e76f2d343e8cd367214b4b5ce52b3b97be262

                With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->
                /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/

                0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that
        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by
        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to
